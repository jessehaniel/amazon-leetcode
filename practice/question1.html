          Amazon is building a way to help customers search reviews quicker by
          providing real-time suggestions to search terms when the customer
          starts typing. When given a minimum of two characters into the search
          field the system will suggest at most three keywords from the review
          word repository. As the customer continues to type in the reviews
          search bar the relevant keyword suggestions will update automatically.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Write an algorithm that will output a maximum of three keyword
          suggestions after each character is typed by the customer in the
          search field.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          If there are more than three acceptable keywords, return the keywords
          that are first in alphabetical order.<br />
          Only return keyword suggestions after the customer has entered two
          characters.<br />
          Keyword suggestions must start with the characters already typed
        </p>

        <p>
          Both the repository and the customerQuery should be compared in a
          case-insensitive way.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Input</strong><br />
          The input to the method/function consists of two arguments:<br />
          <em>repository, </em>a list of unique strings representing the various
          keywords from the Amazon review comment section;<br />
          <em>customerQuery, </em>a string representing the full search query of
          the customer.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Output</strong><br />
          <span
            style="
              color: rgb(33, 47, 62);
              font-family: Ember, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI',

            >Return a list of a list of strings in lower case</span
          >, where each list represents the keyword suggestions made by the
          system as the customer types each character of the customerQuery.
          Assume the customer types characters in order without deleting or
          removing any characters. If an output is not possible, return an empty
          array ([]).
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          <strong>Example</strong><br />
          Input:<br />
          repository = [ "mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"
          ]<br />
          customerQuery = "mouse"
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Output:<br />
          ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"]<br />
          ["mouse", "mousepad"]<br />
          ["mouse", "mousepad"]<br />
          ["mouse", "mousepad"]
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <p>
          Explanation:<br />
          The chain of words that will generate in the search box will be<br />
          mo, mou, mous, mouse<br />
          and each line from output shows the suggestion of "mo", "mou", "mous",
          "mouse", respectively in each line.<br />
          For the keyword suggestions made by the system that are generated for
          'mo', the matches that will be generated are:["mobile", "mouse",
          "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]<br />
          Alphabetically, they will be reordered to [ "mobile", "moneypot",
          "monitor", "mouse", "mousepad" ].<br />
          Thus the keyword suggestions made by the system are [ "mobile",
          "moneypot", "monitor"].
